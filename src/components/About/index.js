            I'm Andrew, a biomedical engineer who recently dived head first into
            software engineering.

          While I am new to this industry, programming is not foreign to me; I
          started my journey in university learning MATLAB, LabVIEW, and C.
          After graduation, I went to work for a magnet hospital in the Houston
          Medical Center, assembling and managing LVADs. While I have learned
          much from my job, I am ready for my next chapter in life- to learn
          more, to be more, to grow more. <br />

          When I'm not behind my computer, there is always a plant that needs
          watering or a good book to read. I lately have been expanind my recipe
          box and cooking more- as well as fermenting my own wine. May our paths
          cross soon!
